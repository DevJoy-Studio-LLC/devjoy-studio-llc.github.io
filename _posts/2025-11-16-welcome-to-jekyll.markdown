We've all sat at our desk trying to answer this question. What the heck did I even do last year? 

The question is important and a lot of us must answer it every year. Yes, the dreaded annual performance review. Every 365 days, usually between January and March, we need to describe how we think we did during the year, highlight our achievements, and boast a little so we can hopefully influence the small raise we'll get at work.

As creatives, it can be hard sometimes to remember what we worked on just yesterday. It can be even harder to remember what we did last month. Remembering what we were up to twelves months ago? That's almost impossible.

To help us, we look at old work tickets, search through emails, or even look are our calendar invites from 10 months ago. We get carpal tunnel syndrome while scrolling up in various Slack channels, looking for anything important we might have said. Some years, we remember we did something worth bringing up, but with the passage of time, it doesn't really feel that important anymore. Should it even be mentioned?

There is a solution to this, and it only takes a few minutes every day: write a work log.

## The work log

Maintaining a daily work log can be an incredibly useful practice to resolve this problem. It can be a simple document that you open up every day to add an entry. It could also be an application, like the one we are trying to build.

The key is that it must be easy to access and write to, otherwise we'll find a million reasons not to go write our work log on a particular day. It must also be searchable and readable.

## What does a work log look like?

Every day, make an entry into your work log and be sure to add the date. You should then write down the projects you've been working on, followed by some details. For example, this is an example of one of my work log entries from last week:

```
## Tue Nov 11 2025

- Finding Work
  - A recruiter reached out about a possible position in Austin. Booked some time on his calendar

- Journal App
  - Improved the Figma design. It's more responsive now
  - [plan] Still planning to start the design of the evented architecture
```

My work log entries are done using markdown syntax, but yours don't have to be. What important, though, is to have some structure that is repeatable. My logs are dated using the `Www Mmm dd yyyy` format, where `Www` represents the day of the week using three letters only, `Mmm` is the month of the year, again with just three letters, `dd` is the day and `yyyy` is the year. 

I use that date format because it's what my Mac shows in the top right corner of the screen at all times, so it's pretty easy to see and copy.

Then, I list my projects. In the example above, I only have two projects: `Finding Work` and `Journal App`. I have many more ongoing projects, but on that day, I only worked on those two.

Under each project, I list the work I did that particular day. Reading that work log, I immediately remember that I spent a lot of time that day tweaking the Figma design for my Journaling app to make it more responsible to size changes.

Your format might be different than mine. The key is being consistent over time.

## Start today!

Because we are getting close to performance review season, the best time to start your work log was last year, unfortunately. But to get a head start on next year, you should start your daily practice today.

Here's what you stand to gain:

- **A memory bank**: A searchable record of everything you've worked on
- **A decision journal**: Context for why you did things the way you did
- **Your performance review cheat sheet**: A list of accomplishments that you can brag about

Try it! There are zero downsides. 

## What's Next?

We're currently in the early stages of building a work log and journaling app, and we'd love your input. The application will allow you to write a private journal that only you can see, and write a public work log that you and your coworkers can see. The benefit to a public work log are that you can keep up with what your colleagues are up to. You can also search their work logs to find useful information that informed their decisions, designs, and other outputs that affect the whole team.

Drop us a line at [hello@devjoy.studio](mailto:hello@devjoy.studio). We'd love to hear your thoughts about an application like this and keep you updated as we build this. Be among the first people to get access to early releases and influence how we build the app!
